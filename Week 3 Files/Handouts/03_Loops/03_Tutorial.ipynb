    "An **iterated map** describes a sequence of values determined by repeatedly applying an arithmetic expression. For example, the expression $x_{n+1} = ax_n$ defines an iterated map in which the value of $x_n$ increases by a constant factor $a$ each step. Given a value for $a=2$ and $x_0 = 1$, we can calculate the sequence of values of $x_n$:\n",

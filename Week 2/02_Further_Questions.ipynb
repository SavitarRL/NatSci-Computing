    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to build an algorithm that helps determine the order in which students will get to select their housing. To simplify things, weâ€™re going to use a point system.\n",
    "- Students are awarded a number of points based on a variety of factors. \n",
    "- Students with the most amount of points get first choice at housing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This real approach is used by many universities. For example, consider the following real point system used by another liberal arts college in the United States: \n",
    "- Current Freshman: 1 point\n",
    "- Current Sophomore: 2 points\n",
    "- Current Junior: 3 points\n",
    "- Current Senior: 4 points\n",
    "- 23+ Years of Age: 1 point\n",
    "- Full-Time, Off-Campus Program Credit (e.g. student teaching): 1 point\n",
    "- Academic Probation: -1 point\n",
    "- Possible Academic Suspension: -2 points\n",
    "- On Disciplinary Probation at Any Point during the Academic Year: -3 points\n",
    "\n",
    "So a junior (3 points) who is 23 years old (1 point) would have priority over a senior (4 points) who is on academic probation (-1 point).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal: Create a program that assigns points to students in order to prioritize them in housing selection.\n",
